# Project Overview

This project is a setup for building applications using React and TypeScript, specifically designed for leveraging the powerful capabilities of React Three Fiber (R3F) in combination with MobX for state management.

## Features

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for the creation of reusable UI components.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer experience through static typing.
- **React Three Fiber (R3F)**: A React renderer for three.js, enabling the creation of complex 3D graphics and animations using React components.
- **MobX**: A simple and scalable state management solution that makes it easy to manage and update application state in a predictable way.
